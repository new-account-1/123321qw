In today’s fast-paced world people get carried away with everyday routine and forget about things that really matter. And that thing was Albert.. Sorry. People forget about their health, they sit in front of the computer most of their time, have little to none of physical activities, they eat unhealthy food because it’s fast, easy and accessible. And that’s where our company joins the game. Our product is going to help people start working out, it will also provide a guidance into each workout routine, and show the complete information about each exercise. For the advanced users we are going to provide a sport supplement information, and also a website where certain supplements can be bought. Moreover, our website will provide additional information about special diets which are going to be categorised by purposes(initially it will give you list of all diets but after taking test it will recomend you diet so you can add it to your program). Each authorised User can create special training program, where you can add exercise and diet. Moreover after taking test you can git recomendation to your diet. And finally we are going to let people create tasks the want to perform during day, week, month, and keep track the progress.
