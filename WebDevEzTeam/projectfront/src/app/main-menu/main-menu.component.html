<h1 class="animated lightSpeedIn delay-1s title-text">Welcome to our website!</h1>
<p class="animated slideInLeft delay-2s body-text">We live in a modern world, where speed and convenience play the major role in almost every aspect of our lives. Unfortunately, while some institutions benefit from this situation, there are many examples of how hurtful modern lifestyle can be, but don’t worry, every issue can be addressed and solved accordingly.<br></p> 
<p class="animated slideInRight delay-3s body-text"> The first problem we are facing every day is bad eating habits. This issue mostly comes from laziness and fast-paced lifestyle. We also have the illusion of not having enough time to cook, what leads us to having to go to the fast food restaurants, and by doing that, we spend more money and also pay with our health later on.  
    However, human body is designed in a way, that every single change that you make in your lifestyle translates into your inner health. For example, take a look the different <a routerLink="/dietary" routerLinkActive="active" class="btn btn-success">diets</a> , and find the one that fits your preferences.</p><br>
<p class="animated slideInLeft delay-3s body-text">Another issue is lack of mobility. We always think that we don’t have enough time to go to the gym, we choose public transport over walking, we can’t force ourselves to start working on ourselves, and all that pushes us towards big bellies, heavy breathing, serious deceases and for some cases even death.
    It’s obviously not necessary to go to the gym 7 days a week, to workout for 10 hours each of the days, but it is definitely important to be involved in different activities in order to stay active and keep your body fit. For that reason we divided our exercises section into 3 <a routerLink="/exercises" routerLinkActive="active" class="btn btn-primary">categories</a>: 
    Beginner, Continuing, and Advanced, so it could be easy for you to pick up your workout routine that suits your needs and time situation the best. In each one of them you can find useful information of how to perform certain exercises, what muscle groups it helps to develop and what kind of equipment is needed.
